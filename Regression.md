### Example:

You are going to buy a house in a state of a country. Of course this house; you need to do Regression to make predictions with the criteria you want, whether it is cheap, close to the sea, close to the forest, with a beautiful view, etc.

### Another Example:

You have a company. You advertise in various areas such as TV, Radio and Newspaper etc. Now, which platform will increase your sales if you advertise more here? Which platform will raise you more? You will find the answer to these questions with the Regression method.

The dataset given here contains the data about the sales of the product. The dataset is about the advertising cost incurred by the business on various advertising platforms. Below is the description of all the columns in the dataset:
 - 	TV: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on TV;
 - 	Radio: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on Radio;
 - 	Newspaper: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on Newspaper;
 - 	Sales: Number of units sold
