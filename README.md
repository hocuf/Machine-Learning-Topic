# Machine Learning Topic 


#### Machine learning is part of the field of artificial intelligence.

The use of data and algorithms is actually important for the intelligence of machines. We will repeat this often in this article. If you have data, anything is possible, with certain scores. For example, it helps you to discover and recognise relationships; we can talk about gradually imitating the way humans learn, improving accuracy, making sense of patterns, predicting trends and associations, etc. 

# DATA -> PREDICTION

## Supervised Learning:

Supervised Learning is analysed in 2 parts. Regression and Classification. The features that apply to both are that there is data and there is a target.
# " [Regression](Regression.md) - [Classification](Classification.md) " 

## Unsupervised Learning:
I have analysed Unsupervised Learning in one piece. Clustering is the healthiest. Its feature is that there is data and there is no target, using similarities.
