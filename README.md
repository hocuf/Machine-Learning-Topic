# Regression Topic 


#### Machine learning is part of the field of artificial intelligence.

The use of data and algorithms is actually important for the intelligence of machines. We will repeat this often in this article. If you have data, anything is possible, with certain scores. For example, it helps you to discover and recognise relationships; we can talk about gradually imitating the way humans learn, improving accuracy, making sense of patterns, predicting trends and associations, etc. 

# DATA -> PREDICTION


PUUUUUU:

Machine learning is analysed in two parts. “Supervised – Unsupervised”(buraya bir tablo yapariz)

Supervised -> There is data. Target exists.
Unsupervised -> Data exists. No target. Similarity is found.

Yes! How can I learn Regression in one day? Wait, what? 1 day? Yess babe. Letsss start.
"Regression."

We use it to estimate a number, salary, air temperature, melting point, boiling point, etc. all numerical situations belonging to the data we have.

Example:

You are going to buy a house in a state of a country. Of course this house; you need to do Regression to make predictions with the criteria you want, whether it is cheap, close to the sea, close to the forest, with a beautiful view, etc.

Another Example:

You have a company. You advertise in various areas such as TV, Radio and Newspaper etc. Now, which platform will increase your sales if you advertise more here? Which platform will raise you more? You will find the answer to these questions with the Regression method.
