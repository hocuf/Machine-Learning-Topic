# Machine Learning Topic 


#### Machine learning is part of the field of artificial intelligence.

The use of data and algorithms is actually important for the intelligence of machines. We will repeat this often in this article. If you have data, anything is possible, with certain scores. For example, it helps you to discover and recognise relationships; we can talk about gradually imitating the way humans learn, improving accuracy, making sense of patterns, predicting trends and associations, etc.

## Supervised Learning:
There is data. Target exists.

## Unsupervised Learning:
Data exists. No target. Similarity is found.
